Ever wanted a nice GUI to manage your LWC protections? Want no more! With complete option support for LWC all you have to do is look at the item you want to lock or edit and press "L". Then just fill in the options in the intuitive GUI interface. Just separate names with a comma: ",".

To unlock your password protected blocks just press "U" for an unlock GUI!
